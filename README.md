For IS601-851's homework

1. I followed the tutorial and doc. Then made a little demo - a web addition calculator has flash function. Very simple but I learned a lot.

2. If you input two numbers and then click "Do Add", you will get the addition result by flash.

3. If you didn't input either of them, you will get a flash to warning to input numbers.
